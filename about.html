      <b>What: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      This is a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for 
      scientific computation. Based on The Hacker Within Scientific Computing 
      Group from the University of Wisconsin Madison, Ana Malagon jumpstarted a 
      Yale chapter.  

      The goal is to learn cool skills and incorporate these practices into our 
      workflows. This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new 
      libraries, showing off useful features of a neutronics code you're using, 
      or bringing up a computational problem you're having.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Where: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      2150 Shattuck, Suite 230
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Who:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to 
      come to our meetings. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>When:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Sundays at midnight. (Just kidding. Ana, you'll want to fill this out).
      To keep up with meetings, you may want to  
      <a 
        href="local.listhost.url.here">sign 
        up for the listhost</a>.
      </p>


      <p>
      <b>How:</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Participating is really easy. 
      <b>First,</b> you'll show up. <b>Second,</b> you'll watch a short 
      discussion of some computational topic. To volunteer to give this talk, 
      just let the listhost know by email at <a 
        href="mailto:local.listhost.url.here">local.listhost.url.here</a>. 
      <b>Next,</b> there will be some time devoted to current updates or questions you 
      and other attendees have about your own computational work. 
      <b>Finally,</b> there 
      will be a time for a couple of Lightning Talks, which are 5-10 minute 
      blasts of information about a particular topic or question of interest to 
      the group.  
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Why: </b>
      </p>
      <p>
      The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility, 
      comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail 
      to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version 
      control, automated documentation, and others.</p>
      <p>
      To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for 
      computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The 
      Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 
      is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of 
      the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their 
      education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in 
      using computing to accomplish their work.</p>
