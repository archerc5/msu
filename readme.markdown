# The Hacker Within at MSU

This is the website that keeps the blog posts for each THW meeting at Michigan 
State University. The rendered website can be found 
[here](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/msu).

## How to Contribute

- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/msu)
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/msu`
- change branches into the gh-pages branch `git checkout gh-pages`
- **Optional:** Add the THW remote `cd msu&&git remote add upstream 
  git@github.com:thehackerwithin/msu`


### Creating a Post

In the directory that you just cloned (msu), you'll notice a `_posts` 
directory. You'll also notice a `_drafts` directory. In the drafts directory, 
you'll find an empty template for meeting minutes 
`YYYY-MM-DD-subject.markdown`. If you're preparing for a special holiday meeting 
on March 1, 2015, then the proper name for the file you're creating should be 
something like 2015-03-01-katysbirthday.markdown.

- In the msu directory, execute `cp _drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-subject.markdown 
  _posts/2015-03-01-katysbirthday.markdown
- Then, edit that file as you see fit
- Add that file to the repository `git add _posts/2015-03-01-katysbirthday.markdown`
- Commit it: `git commit -am "adds a post for march 1"`
- Push it to your fork `git push origin gh-pages`
- Check if it worked at https://YOUR-USER.github.io/msu .
- Iterate on this until you're happy 
- and then either push to the upstream gh-pages remote branch or make a pull request.

### Modifying a Post

This is very similar to creating a post:

- edit the post
- Commit it: `git commit -am "adds a post for march 1"
- Push it to your fork `git push origin gh-pages`
- Check if it worked at https://YOUR-USER.github.io/msu .
- Iterate on this until you're happy 
- and then either push to the upstream gh-pages remote branch or make a pull request.

### Build the site locally

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## We use Left to lay out this jekyll

It's all based on something @katyhugg forked. It's called Left.  It uses jekyll.  It was
extracted from [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/).

Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
